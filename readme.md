# Project Title: SII Recibidas Processing

This project is designed to process and analyze the Suministro Inmediato de Informaci√≥n (SII) files provided by Hacienda. These files contain information about the received invoices by companies whose turnover exceeded 6 million.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- openpyxl
- chardet
- tkinter
- os

## Files

The project contains the following Python scripts:

- `calculateBasesTipos.py`: Contains functions for specific calculations.
- `introFunc.py`: Contains helper functions for file handling and data loading.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the processing pipeline.
- `output.py`: Contains the function `write_to_xlsx` for writing the processed data to an Excel file.
